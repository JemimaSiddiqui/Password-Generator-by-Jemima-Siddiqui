# 03 About the Project - Password Generator

The Password Generator project consists of an application where users are able to generate passwords based on a specified criteria. By clicking on "Generate Password", users are presented with a series of prompts for the password generator to generate a random password based on user input. The prompts ask the user about the length of the password (8-128 characters), and confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. The corresponding random password is then generated and displayed on the page.
